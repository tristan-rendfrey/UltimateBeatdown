# UltimateBeatdown

To start Ultimate Beatdown:
Run "ultimateBeatdown.py" using Python 3 (it will fail in 2.7).
 
classLibrary contains data for all characters, 
specialLibrary contains special ability sets for all characters,
battler.py runs combat simulations,
simulateCombat provides general simulation framework. 

This is in an extremely early and raw phase, I expect errors and imbalancing abound.
